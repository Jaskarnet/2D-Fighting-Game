**Abstract:**

Below is a brief summary of the diploma thesis, taken from its content:

 _The thesis provides details of the process of creating the title game. It begins with
 an analysis of the project’s foundational concepts, defining the application’s main
 functions, user interface, and unique features that set it apart from other games in
 its genre. The implementation phase, including the selection and application of
 Java technology and the libGDX framework, is thoroughly discussed. This part
 of the thesis considers various technical aspects, from game mechanics and collision systems to character animation, data management, and network interactions.
 Subsequent sections are dedicated to game testing, both functional and in terms of
 stability and performance, ensuring that the game meets all set objectives. The final
 chapter summarizes the entire game development process, drawing conclusions and
 recommendations for future work. This thesis serves as a knowledge resource on
 the design, implementation, and testing process of computer games, emphasizing
 2D fighting games and the challenges of creating online games._
